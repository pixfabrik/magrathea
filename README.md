### Backlog

- Cycle blending
- Optimize cycling so we only touch the pixels that need to change
- What to do during transition if there are different cycles between palettes?
- Support reverse 4
- Normalize our cycle data so it's not LBM specific
- Support 24 hour clock if the locale is using it
- The AM/PM in the time controls are getting clipped by the clock icon
- Customize ESLint so it doesn't complain about unused variables
- Enable Typescript on server-side
